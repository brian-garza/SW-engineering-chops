# SW-engineering-chops
Going through some exercises to improve my software engineering/development chops to better understand the needs of our team's direct customers, software engineers.

## Notes for next steps
```[tasklist]
- [ ] Identify and define the function of the program (given a floating point value for lat/long, define a start and end point as required input.  Output will provide an "as the crow flies" distance between the two provided start/end points).

- [ ] Identify the behaviors you wish to see that are encapsulated to a specific class.

- [ ] Walk through the entry points of the program through all code pathways defined in Step 2 to ensure that your input and output can be calculated.  This is done through the Class diagram, not code.  Once your able to do this, you can commence to Step 4.

- [ ] Write the unit test that fails, but validates the Step 1 conditions.  It will fail because you've not yet written the code to realize Step 3.

- [ ] Write the code defined in your Class diagram.

- [ ] Your unit test(s) defined in Step 4 should pass.
